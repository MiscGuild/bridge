## Features

-   Bridges between Discord and Hypixel guild chats.
-   Sends all guild related messages, including chat, guild announcements and more to Discord.
-   Automatic restarts and reconnections.
-   Privileged slash commands to control bot behaviour in-game.
-   Toggleable slowmode to control member usage.
-   Basic filtering of extreme profanity to protect bot accounts from abuse.
-   Configurable in-game reminders to spread the word about news and upcoming events.
-   **üîå Mineflayer Extension System**: Universal plugin system for extending bot functionality with custom chat commands and patterns.

## Mineflayer Extension System

This bridge includes a powerful extension system that allows you to add custom functionality without modifying the core bot code. Create extensions that respond to chat patterns, handle commands, and integrate with Discord.

### Quick Start with Extensions

```bash
# Build the extension system
./build-extensions.sh

# Test the extension system
node test-extensions.mjs

# Create a new extension
node src/plugin-system/mineflayer-extension-cli.js create "My Extension"

# List extensions
node src/plugin-system/mineflayer-extension-cli.js list
```

### Features

- **Chat Pattern Routing**: Automatically routes chat messages to appropriate extensions
- **Priority System**: Handle conflicts between patterns with priority levels
- **Hot Reloading**: Reload extensions without restarting the bot
- **Discord Integration**: Built-in Discord webhook and message support
- **Configuration Management**: Schema-based config validation
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitor extension health and performance
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for managing extensions

See the [Extension Documentation](src/plugin-system/MINEFLAYER_EXTENSIONS.md) for detailed guides and examples.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm
-   A full access Minecraft Java Edition account

### Setup

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) via one of their [installation methods](https://pnpm.io/installation), or the following command:

```bash
$ npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Clone the repository into a directory of your choice.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MiscGuild/bridge.git
```

3. Enter the new directory and install packages.

```bash
$ cd bridge
$ pnpm install
```

4. Make a new Discord bot account on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and retrieve the bot token.

5. Under the `Bot` tab, grant the bot the `Message Content` Intent.

6. Generate an invite URL by going to the OAuth2 tab and clicking on the URL Generator. Add the `bot` and `application.commands` scopes, before opening the link to invite the bot to your server.

7. Setup the project config files.

```bash
$ pnpm run setup-files
```

8. Fill out the `.env` file with your Minecraft account email and other details.

9. Promote the Minecraft account used by the bot to Officer in-game in order for it to view the Officer chat and run privileged commands.

10. On Hypixel, set the account's `Private Message Privacy` setting under `My Profile > Social Settings` to `Low` or `High`, allowing guild members to privately message the bot to see their weekly guild experience total.

11. Build and run the bot.

```bash
$ pnpm run build
$ pnpm start
```

### Hypixel API keys

After the June 2023 [Hypixel Public API update](https://hypixel.net/threads/hypixel-developer-dashboard-public-api-changes-june-2023.5364455/), Development API Keys now expire after three days but can be easily renewed.

To acquire a permanent key, first generate a Development Key [here](https://developer.hypixel.net/dashboard). Then, fill out the form under `Apps > Create app > Personal API Key`. Please note that applications concerning bridge bots may be denied.

Alternatively, you may omit the `HYPIXEL_API_KEY` field of the `.env` file, but some features such as minimum network level enforcement will be disabled.

### Process management

If you are self-hosting or your process manager does not automatically restart the bot in the event of a crash, you may use [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), a process manager for Node.js applications.

Use the `pm2:start` script instead of the `start` script to launch the bot. To stop the process, use the `pm2:kill` script.

```bash
$ pnpm run pm2:start
$ pnpm run pm2:kill
```

Please refer to the [PM2 documentation](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) for more configuration options and information about PM2.
