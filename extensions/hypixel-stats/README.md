## Architecture

The extension follows a modular architecture:

```

    ├── megawalls.ts      # Mega Walls statistics handler
    └── arcade.ts         # Arcade statistics handler
```

## Usage

Once loaded, the extension automatically registers all game mode patterns and handles stat requests:

1. Players use commands like `!bw Technoblade` in guild chat
2. Extension checks cooldowns and validates the username
3. Fetches data from Mojang and Hypixel APIs
4. Processes stats through the appropriate game mode handler
5. Sends formatted results to guild chat

## Error Handling

The extension handles various error scenarios:
- Invalid usernames
- Player not found
- API timeouts
- Rate limiting
- Missing game mode data

## Development

Each game mode handler implements the `StatsHandler` interface:

```typescript
interface StatsHandler {
  buildStatsMessage(playerData: HypixelPlayerProfile, username: string): string;
}
```

To add a new game mode:
1. Create a new handler in the `handlers/` directory
2. Implement the `StatsHandler` interface
3. Add the handler to the exports in `handlers/index.ts`
4. Add the command pattern to the main extension
