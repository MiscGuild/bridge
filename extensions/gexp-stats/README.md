## Technical Details

- **Number Formatting**: Automatically formats large numbers (1000+ = K, 1,000,000+ = M)

## Example Outputs

```
[GEXP] IGN: Technoblade | Weekly: 125.4K | Daily: 18.2K | AVG: 17.9K | #abc123

## Usage

Once loaded, the extension automatically registers the `!gexp` command pattern. Players can use:

1. `!gexp` - Check their own GEXP stats
2. `!gexp PlayerName` - Check another player's GEXP stats

The extension will fetch the player's guild membership, extract their GEXP history, and provide a formatted summary of their recent guild activity.
